PillPal: Need PILLZ? We yo PAL.

We created a pill dispenser that can be easily customized through an intuitive UI. The chute is made from laser-cut acrylic parts, and the dispensing mechanism is powered by a servo motor. We used code from our previous assignments for our project, along with lecture code.

We worked together in the PRL to design, cut, and glue the mechanical parts. We also worked together to connect the mechanical parts with our code.

Kelsey worked on configuring the small screen to the buttons, programming the user interface, and saving user input.
Khoi worked on connecting the servo motor to the raspberry pi and controlling the motor's movement through code.
