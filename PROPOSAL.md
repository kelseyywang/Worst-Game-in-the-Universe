PillPal

Team members:

Kelsey Wang - responsibility: build structural component of the prototype, build and program button-based UI attached to a monitor for users to input drug regimens

Khoi Le - responsibility: build motor component of prototype and belt, program user provided drug regimens into motor movement
Combined responsibilities: create final product parts and attach to individual components, code timer interval to dispense pills automatically

The goal of this project is to create a programmable pill dispenser, with a simple enough UI for anyone to use. We want to ensure that the pill dispenser is adaptable for users’ various medication needs, and that it is reliable and easy to use on a daily basis.

Hardware:
We plan on having a motor-powered, chute-like mechanism with an “airlock” style compartment to release pills one by one, with each chute containing one type of medication. The pills are released into a single compartment, with pill combinations differing per day based on initial user input. User input is handled with a screen and simple buttons (one button per medication, and an “enter” button).

User interface:
The screen first prompts the user to enter the daily frequencies that the user takes medications (i.e. “once per day,” “once per meal,” or “every ___ hours”), then allows the user to input the medications taken during each interval, for an entire week. This information is saved, and the weekly regimen is repeated, or until the user chooses to change it.

Milestones for T-1 week:

•Have prototype for chute and motor belt constructed 

•Be able to control motor through Pi 

•Have screen register button presses 

Resources needed:

•Servo motors 

•Acrylic for final product chute 

•Buttons 

•Small screen
